## How It's Made:

I created this app to grab the users time zone, call the NASA API for said time zone and date, and then Display the Picture of the day provided by NASA with a quick description of said picture. For somedays where NASA provides a video instead, I call to display the video embeded on the website and once that day passes, it switches back to only show the Picture of the day automatically.

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NASA API
